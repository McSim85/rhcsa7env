# Vagrant/Ansible for RHCSA 7 Study/Test Environment.

## Required software before setting up:
- Ansible - (`yum install ansible` or `brew install ansible`)
- Python - (`yum install python`or `brew install python`)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) - (`brew cask install vagrant`)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (`brew cask install VirtualBox`)

### This environment includes two systems:
- ipa.example.com
- system1.example.com

### Network Details:
###### ipa
192.168.55.5
###### system1
192.168.55.6

### Username/Password
- Username - vagrant
- Password - vagrant
- For root - use `sudo` or `sudo su`
### LDAP users
- Username = dave, lisa
- Password = password

## Set Up Instructions
1. Create a seperate `/bin` directory and `cd` to it. 
2. Clone the environment repo to it with `git clone https://github.com/rdbreak/rhcsa7env.git`
3. Run `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` to deploy the environment _(You must be in the directory you cloned the repo to in order to run vagrant commands.)_

_NOTE - You can use the VirtualBox console to interact with the VMs or through a terminal. If you need to reset the root password, you would need to use the console though._

The first time you run the vagrant up command, it will download the OS images for later use. In other words, it will take longest the first time around but will be faster when it is deployed again. You can run `vagrant destroy -f` to destroy your environment at anytime. **This will erase everything**. This environment is meant to be reuseable, If you run the `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` command after destroying the environment, the OS image will already be downloaded and environment will deploy faster. Once the setup is complete, the ipa server and client for realm EXAMPLE.COM will already be setup and paired. Deployment should take around 10 minutes depending on your computer. Hope this helps you in your studies!
